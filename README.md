## Injector v0.1
Intended to become a parallel, non-blocking, distributed, persistent dataflow computing framework, for now, just have fun with map, filter/reject, generate and reduce as seen in the example in modules/ and run.rb

## TODO
Especially DB access, non-blocking IO; capability based security to be enforced; bindings for other programming languages would be nice
